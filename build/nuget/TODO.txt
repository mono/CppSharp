Notes and TODOs

- Microsoft.VisualStudio.Setup.Configuration.Interop has been added to nuspec,
  but for some reason it never copies itself to output, it has to be done manually.
  Additionally, the 64-bit nuget package does not need that (TODO Confirm this).

- Baseclass.Contrib.Nuget.Output is problematic, whenever you update it,
  Visual Studio complains and says it must restart, over and over.

- Nuget package warnings should be fixed/suppressed.

- Should there be two packages : x86 and x64 ?

- Only Visual Studio 2017 32-bit solution is supported, once a 64-bit solution
  is available, build.cake should be enhanced.

- Whatever else I've missed ...
