NOTES
=====

Microsoft.VisualStudio.Setup.Configuration.Interop added to nuspec, but for some reason it never copies itself to output directory, it has to be done manually.

Baseclass.Contrib.Nuget.Output is problematic, too, whenever you update it VS will complain it needs to be restarted over and over.

TODO
====

Script is only for 64-bit Windows, is it really worth supporting 32-bit Windows ?

Script does not support 64-bit release of C++#, it should be possible to support it by say having two other batch files that call it with a parameter.

Script only supports Visual Studio 2017 folder, it could be detected in a simple manner with 'for' (assuming a dev works against a single IDE).

The nuspec file should be updated accordingly for 64-bit package.

Currently, nuget pack warnings are suppressed.
