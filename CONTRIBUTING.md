The most common contribution for any open source project are bug reports.
We always welcome them because we want to be aware of our mistakes in order to make our product better.
However, we are not always able to fix bugs ourselves right away and for free. So you can help further in two ways:

1. Instead of working around issues with your own custom passes or in other ways, you could fix the problem and send us a pull request.
In most cases this is no more difficult and takes just as much time. Besides, we are always here to help;
2. Using our support options at https://github.com/mono/CppSharp#support guarantees a much faster and effective response.
