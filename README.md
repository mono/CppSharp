CppSharp is a tool and set of libraries which allows programmers to use
C/C++ libraries with high-level programming languages (such as C#).

It is a tool that takes C/C++ header and library files and generates the 
necessary glue to surface the native API as a managed API. Such an API can be
used to consume an existing native library in your high-level code or add
scripting support to a native codebase.

The supported target languages at present are C# and C++/CLI.

It can also be used as a library to parse native code into a syntax tree with a
rich declaration and type information model.

## Libraries

### AST 

Mirrors the Clang's C/C++ AST and type system classes in C# APIs.

Check out [_Clang's AST introduction docs_](http://clang.llvm.org/docs/IntroductionToTheClangAST.html) for more details about its architecture.
 
 * C++ declarations
 * C++ types
 * Class object layout
 * Declaration visitors
 * Type visitors

### Parser

Provides APIs for parsing of C/C++ source code into a syntax tree.

* Parsing of C/C++ source code
* Parsing of libraries archives symbols
* Parsing of shared libraries symbols 
* Based on the very accurate Clang C++ parser.

### Generator

Generates the glue binding code from a syntax tree of the native code.
 
 * Multiple backends: C++/CLI and C# (P/Invoke)
 * Multiple ABIs: Itanium, MS, ARM, iOS
 * Multiple platforms: Windows, OS X and Linux
 * Multiple runtimes: .NET and Mono
 * C++ virtual methods overriding from managed code
 * C++ multiple inheritance by translating to C# interfaces
 * C++ std::string
 * C++ default parameter values
 * C/C++ semantic comments (Doxygen) to C# comments
 * Extensible bindings semantics via user passes and type mapping
